Nowadays, Shanghai is one of China’s largest cities, with a population of 17.73 million, a GDP over three trillion yuan, and a magnificent skyline. But, before the 20th century, Shanghai was just a simple village. Shanghai’s transformation from a village to a booming metropolis occurred during the 19th and 20th century. It was caused by a few key events: the trade treaty of 1842, the Boom in the 1920s, the Cultural Revolution in 1967, and the modern reform in 1978. These events formed distinct time periods: foreign rule, nationalist rule, Maoist communism, the Cultural revolution, and post Mao modernism. 
These time periods had a massive unmistakable impact on STARPAP and had a similar effect on each topic. If you were to graph out the strength and significance of each topic over time, the graphs would all look quite similar. They would start low, start rising after 1842, spike during the 1920s Boom, continue to rise steadily until the Cultural Revolution in 1967, where they would drastically drop, then rise rapidly after 1978.
Change in Shanghai happened at a rapid pace, putting the city in a state of constant flux. People were constantly coming and going, governments changed every few decades, and new buildings and facilities were frequently established. In the essays below, I will explain transformation process of one of modern China’s most powerful and innovative cities.


Architecture

	Shanghainese architecture is truly impressive and stands out from most other Chinese buildings, but these buildings would not exist if it wasn’t for the architects who designed them. What made these buildings stand out in the late 19th century and the early 20th century is their western influence, mainly the Art Deco style. These architects implemented the western styles, transforming Shanghai. The Shanghai’s willingness to adopt the western styles demonstrates how the Shanghainese value learning from others and their positive relationship with foreigners.
	A prime example of the western influence is The Bund, one of the most well known buildings in Shanghai. The Bund begun as a trading house, but over time it grew and grew, eventually becoming a huge commercial hub full of consumer services such as luxury hotels and clubhouses. The Bund served as a benchmark for Shanghainese architecture displaying the Art Deco style on such a large scale.
	During the 1920s Shanghai experienced a huge a architectural and economic leap forward, known as The Boom. During the Boom, many architects (lots were returning Shanghainese scholars) arrived to Shanghai and set up their own practices. One of these architects was the Hungarian-Slovakian László Ede Hudec or Ladislav Hudec. Hudec was one of the most influential architects of the time. Hudec was responsible for the creation of some of the most brilliant pieces of Shanghai architecture in the early 20th century including the Park Hotel, Grand Cinema, and Normandie Apartments. Xiahong Hua and Zhengyue Qiao describe him as a “pioneer of Shanghai architecture”, stating that he “captured the spirit of the time”
These buildings and architects triggered a huge wave of western influence to spread through Shanghai. Hua and Qiao further emphasize the importance of the western influence, stating that Shanghai architecture was “co-created by the first generation of Chinese modern architects and numerous foreign architects”. The western influence that was brought to Shanghai transformed the city into a vibrant, dynamic metropolis.


Art

	Late 19th century and early 20th century Shanghai’s value of art and western culture is demonstrated through the architecture. In the architecture essay, I went into depth about the architects and study of architecture. Here, I will discuss the artistic values of the buildings, focusing on the main style of the time—Art Deco. The Art Deco style emphasizes simple geometrical designs, moving away from flamboyant traditional Chinese art and buildings, and displaying the Shanghainese belief in westernization and simplicity.
	As I mentioned in the architecture essay, The Bund acted as a benchmark for future buildings. The Bund is comprised of many different individual buildings, one of them being the Peace (formerly “Cathay”) Hotel. Built in 1929, the Peace Hotel was the first skyscraper in Shanghai which also excellently exhibited the Art Deco style.

	Introducing simplicity and geometry, the Art Deco style truly revolutionized Shanghai’s architecture. Though it may not seem like it, there was long and in-depth planning that went into each building—deciding how certain shapes will complement each other, how vertical lines can create a sense of infinity, and even where to put decoration. There are still many Art Deco buildings that can be seen in modern days after Shanghai’s skyline was transformed in the early 20th century.


Philosophy

	In Shanghai during the 20th century, the strong belief in various ideologies—communism, nationalism, consumerism—were shown through large displays of violence, mass protests, and the industrial focus of the city. In the early 20th century a view on Shanghai shared by both the communists and the nationalists was that Shanghai was a disgrace, a parasite. This stemmed from Shanghai’s westernized culture, and foreign control. The foreign control allowed reformers, rebels, and revolutionaries to freely share their ideas without government interference—almost all the challenges to common belief during the early 20th century were published in Shanghai. Despite their disgust with the city, both communists and nationalists conducted large, violent operations to gain control of the city.
	Many new forces and organizations took shape in the 1920s. One of them was the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which was founded in house inside the French Concession during the July of 1921. Four years later in 1925, Shanghai and much of southern China found themselves enveloped by Chiang Kai-shek’s army during the nationalist “Northern Expedition”. This was a campaign that moved north—as the name suggests—from Guangzhou, “reconquering” provinces and overthrowing militarists. Though the Nationalist government was founded in Guangzhou the events taking place in Shanghai elevated the ideology more than any others, the biggest being the May 30th Incident. On May 30, 1925, police were unable to break up a protest over a dead Chinese worker in a Japanese factory, so they opened fire on the crowd, killing eleven and wounding many others. This incident caused a huge nationalist uprising—all Shanghainese went on strike, and workers in southern China launched anti-foreign boycotts. The Nationalists took Shanghai in 1927, then began a Communist purge, accomplished with Du Yuesheng, Shanghai’s lead gangster. Communists that survived the purge fled to Jiangxi.
	The Nationalists (GMD) focused more military power eradicating the Communists (CCP), ignoring the Japanese invaders. In 1934, the GMD army surrounded the CCP base in Jiangxi, with the intent of completely destroying it. 100,000 managed to escape Jiangxi, and among the 100,000 was Mao Zedong. The escaped members of the CCP took a journey that would soon be used as a huge piece of propaganda: a year long journey to Yanan on foot, known as The Long March. The CCP eventually took back Shanghai from the Japan-weakened GMD in 1949.
	During the time Mao ruled China, many drastic and violent policies were put into place. The policies brutally punished landowners and citizens that displayed any form of western “bourgeois” influence. Mao pushed these beliefs onto the people who accepted them with open arms. Soon, almost all of China followed these extremist beliefs.
	These belief systems—though they led to many violent and tragic events—have shaped Shanghai to what it is now. Shanghai was always an outlier, with its heavy western influence and foreign population. This became even more evident in the the 20th century as the anti-foreign policies came in. Now, Shanghai is very consumer oriented and westernized, returning to its foreign, early 20th century self.


Politics

The frequency at which drastic policies are implemented demonstrate how many changing and conflicting views there are in 20th century Shanghai. Additionally, it reveals how often governments rise and fall and the necessity to reverse the policies of the former government. This is all made much more evident with policies such as those made during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1967), and the Open Door policy (1978). Though they are not directly policies, the establishment of the concessions and switch from the tribute system to the treaty system are also both very important benchmarks in Shanghai’s political history.
In the early 19th century China had little to no interaction with Western nations, or “Western Barbarians” (the term ‘barbarian’ was used by the Chinese to describe anyone that was not part of the Chinese civilization). This was due to China’s tribute system. The tribute system required any foreigners entering China to completely adopt all Chinese culture and pay tribute, demonstrating that you acknowledged China’s superiority over your nation. This all changed when the Treaty of Nanking occurred in 1842. The treaty granted the British five ports—in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, and Ningbo—and started the era of the Chinese treaty system. The treaty system eventually led to the creation of the foreign concessions: the British concession was formed in 1842 during the Treaty of Nanking, the American concession was formed in 1845, and the French concession was formed in 1848. These foreign concession allowed western culture to permeate into Shanghai, which sparked the westernization and modernization in the early 20th century.
The rise of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) started a new political age for China. Mao immediately enacted many policies harming landowners and people of higher power, but they were not too significant. The more impactful changes came during the Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao recruited young citizens—Red Guards—to destroy the “Four Olds” (old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas) as they treated the revolution, the “new”. Any citizen possessing something the smallest bit related to the Four Olds could easily be the subject of punishment. Mao also carried out a harsh persecution of “intellectuals”—simply anyone of higher social status or education. These intellectuals would be dragged into the streets and beaten by a mob of Red Guards. Mao’s death in 1976 ended the Cultural Revolution and also the reign of the CCP.
Two years following Mao’s death, Deng Xiaoping assumed the position as leader. As soon as he came to power, Deng implemented the Open Door policy. This—as the name states—opened China up to foreign businesses, which accelerated China’s economy, science, and technology. Deng had many other policies that promoted consumerism and globalism demonstrating his unorthodox beliefs when compared to the former government.
Government and policies always play a big role in the overall development of a nation, but more so than ever during 19th and 20th century China. The advantageous and groundbreaking policies are clearly represented by the rise country’s economy, scientific and technological advancement, the people’s appeal, and many other factors. Likewise, detrimental policies are clearly marked by the drop the same categories.


Religion

	During the Cultural Revolution, Mao was intent on destroying the Four Olds—old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas—as mentioned in the politics essay. Mao’s reason for this was to give the people nothing else to believe in except for him and the revolution. This elimination of the Four Olds had an especially large impact on religion, as it fits all four of the categories. In addition, Mao’s plan was essentially to become a god in the eyes of the people, but standing in his way were the deities that the Chinese people had worshiped and created practices around for thousands of years. The destruction of the Four Olds—specifically religion—represents Cultural Revolution era Shanghai’s radical subversive belief to abolish the old and idolize the new.
	As soon as the Cultural Revolution began, religion came to a full stop. Mao and his Red Guards rampaged through the streets, destroying temples, churches and mosques, and burning religious materials—Bibles, copies of the Quran, and other religious artifacts. Not only did Mao destroy sacred buildings and artifacts, but he also directly persecuted many religious people. In the Han areas of China, with were mainly inhabited by ethnic minorities the Cultural Revolution was especially catastrophic. It destroyed life and property on a huge scale and completely ignored human rights—it had an effect similar to that of the holocaust. Complete annihilation of Tibetan monasteries, banning the use of Arabic, and forcing Muslims to raise pigs, and to eat pork are just some of the many horrific measures Mao imposed on the Han Chinese.
	Mao’s method of gaining complete control of China was by using the children. Mao quickly gained the influence of the young by filling them with revolutionary propaganda saying that the young have the power, and to destroy all things old. Mao used these “Red Guards” do his dirty work, destroying religious builds and artifacts as mentioned above, but also flogging teachers, intellectuals, bureaucrats—anyone under bourgeois or Four Olds influence. Many of the Red Guards even called out their own family members as anti-revolutionists.
	During the Cultural Revolution, Mao managed to completely shut down religion. This can still be seen in modern times, as there is an indisputable generation gap in Chinese religious practices. Mao’s actions were truly horrific, but there is no denying his impressive manipulation and the craftsmanship of his propaganda. Mao managed to engross almost every single youth in the China in his revolution. They would all carry out his bidding without a second thought and they worshiped him like a god. 



Science

	The frequency at which students were sent to study abroad, as will as the importance of how education and R&D (research and development) was structured demonstrates 20th century Shanghai’s value in learning. Students were constantly coming and going during the 20th century, even during Maoist times when China had very minimal foreign interaction. This was of course disrupted during Cultural Revolution, when intellectuals were persecuted and sent to work menial jobs. The education and R&D system changed fairly frequently but was constantly under the influence of other nations.
	Students began to leave Shanghai to study in the west and Japan in the early 20th century. This was around the time that foreign concessions began to spread and gain more power and influence. By this time, many western technologies and ideas had been integrated into Shanghai, so Shanghai had a very westernized education system. Education was still very valuable, creating an elitist mentality around those who had it.
	An explosion in Shanghai’s architecture, economy, and population in the 1920s started what is known as “The Boom”. This was caused by the financial depression of Europe and America. Foreign refugees from western nations flooded into Shanghai—Shanghai didn’t require people have passports. All of these new foreigners brought many new scientific ideas into Shanghai, made into reality by the new students returning from their studies abroads.
	The mass of foreigners promptly left after the Japanese bombings in 1937 and the remaining few were placed into construction camps when the Japanese took Shanghai in 1941. 1949 marked the fall of Nationalism and the rise of the CCP who instituted many new education and R&D policies. Firstly, Mao adopted the USSR R&D model. The model emphasized research in institutes under an academy of sciences as opposed to research in universities. This was because they believed that knowledge belonged all people as a free good, greatly undervaluing it. In addition, scientists were told to only research topics that would have practical and immediate action. China closed off to most foreign interactions, but still send students to study in Soviet Russia and accepted Russian advisors and specialists.
	Although knowledge was greatly undervalued, there were certainly still people more knowledgeable than others, primarily the people who received foreign education. These people were the intellectuals. Mao’s extremist views kicked in during the 1960s, starting the Cultural Revolution. Until then, China’s science department had been making substantial amounts of progress. Mao, believing everyone should be equal (with the unmistakable irony of his power), put the people with little to know education in high ranking scientific spots and put the “intellectuals” into simple, menial jobs, only after having them publicly beaten.
	Shortly following Mao’s death and the fall of the CCP, Chinese citizens were sent back to west and Japan, and China reverted back to the university system.
	Shanghai’s history with foreign study, education, and R&D depicts many important messages. The constant fluctuation illustrates the impact of the government on science and learning. In addition, Shanghai’s overall history shows how valuable and helpful foreign ideas can be.


Technology

20th century Shanghai’s ever-changing values are clearly reflected in the city’s various technological focuses, and can even be seen in the absence of technology. This is evident in Shanghai’s four distinct cultural and ideological stages: foreign rule, nationalism, Maoist China, and post Mao China.
When Shanghai was under foreign rule, there was little focus on technology, as citizens were busy with westernized art and architecture. In addition, the foreigners brought their advanced technologies to Shanghai, making it so the Shanghainese could get access to new technology without having to research and develop it on their own. Furthermore, many citizens of foreign Shanghai still followed traditional Chinese culture. Technologically, this was problematic as China had never experienced an industrial revolution—the scholar-bureaucrats who ruled China were never interested in science or technology.
The technological advancement plan during nationalism was created by Sun Yatsen. Sun emphasized industrialization, dreaming of a modern and technologically advanced China. To achieve this, Sun made sure to utilize China’s internationally-trained specialists. Sun’s industrialization plan, as William C. Kirby states, “allowed the government to ‘soar above’ the problems of local and interregional transportation”. The nationalist’s technological power diminished over time, as they focused more and more energy into defeating the communist opposition, and less resources into industrialization.
When CCP took control of Shanghai in 1949, technology was set to top priority and the USSR’s R&D (research and development) model was adopted, as mentioned in the science essay. The model set the priority of the R&D team to military and heavy industry, and neglected the more practical and long-term benefits of researching agriculture or food security. Regardless, the USSR model could definitely have helped mid 20th century China, if it wasn’t constantly changed to fit Mao’s personal vision of technology, which eventually led to the scientific and technological downfall of the Cultural Revolution.
After Mao’s death in 1976, technology started to improve. Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978, and turned China’s R&D on its head. Deng implemented the Open Door policy, which opened up China to foreign businesses—specifically foreign technology. This foreign technology is considered the catalyst for China’s technological modernization. Much less money was invested into military production and more was put into the modernization of agriculture, industry, and medicine. Military industries switched from producing “obsolete tanks and weapons” (Simon, Goldman) to refrigerators and televisions as China became much more consumer oriented. Shanghai’s industry skyrocketed in the 1970s when semiconductors were introduced. Shanghai established one of the best semiconductor industries worldwide, competing with some of the most developed nations of the time.
Though brought with poor execution, technology was China’s primary focus for almost all of the 20th century, and often the motive was to catch up with the more advanced western nations. The different governments often started on the right track, until they made a change that completely derailed their plan; The nationalists were making a solid amount of progress until they turned their attention to exterminating the communists. As for the communists, their attempt at technological progress would have been much more successful, had Mao not tried to implement his own rules and eventually sabotage the whole project with the cultural revolution. China eventually bounced back when Deng Xiaoping to control, correcting many of the mistakes China had made previously.
Conclusion
	The arrival of foreigners, the 1920s Boom, the rise and fall of nationalism and communism, the Cultural Revolution, and the modern reform all made it possible for Shanghai to revolutionize every aspect of the city. Every single event of 19th and 20th century had a tremendous impact on Shanghai, always bring something new to the city. Whether that new “something” helped or hurt the city, it impacted Shanghai in a way that would lead the city to become the modern masterpiece that it is now.
	Though all of these revolutionary events are all related to different subjects, they all came from politics and ideology in one way or another. A trade treaty was signed that allowed foreigners into Shanghai, which also demonstrated the government’s change from the tribute system to the treaty system. The Boom began when foreigners flooded into Shanghai, because Shanghai didn’t require a passport. The Cultural Revolution was purely a product radical communist policies and propaganda that permeated to the people.
	After two centuries of constant flux, Shanghai has slowed down and now rests in a fixed and peaceful state. But, this isn’t without denying the excitement and activity of the modern metropolis. Tourists stroll along the embankment beside the two-hundred year old Bund, taking in the Art Deco architecture that was once the most contemporary aspect of Shanghai. Along Nanjing road, one of the world’s biggest shopping streets, neon lights flash overhead, jutting out from high rises and skyscrapers. Shanghai once again booms with innovation and culture.

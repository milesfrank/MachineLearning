Literature is a profound medium and an integral aspect of many societies. It has existed for centuries across a multitude of civilizations and possesses the power to sway opinions, build communities, peer into the past, or simply entertain. Contrasting and examining texts in various time periods highlights the evolution and significance of literature throughout history. The Judeans and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein allow for this analysis. Judaism—one of the largest early religions—valued its literature, using its sacred texts for a variety of applications. Frankenstein is a timeless novel and a revolutionary piece in its genre, in which the characters read various works of literature. In both Judaism and Frankenstein, texts are used to build foundations for connections, beliefs, and unique interpretations.
The comprehension of literature catalyzed relationships and connections for both the Judeans and Frankenstein’s creature. The Judeans used passages from the Torah to connect both with their family and God, while Frankenstein’s creature uses novels found in the woods—Paradise Lost, Plutarch’s Lives, and Sorrows of Werter—to build empathy with humans. The Torah establishes a strong relationship between humans and God, demonstrated by the numerous occasions God gives instructions and rewards the Judeans upon completion. Such occasions include: when God instructs Abraham to sacrifice his son, God direction for Moses to go to Egypt, and the covenants. This initial relationship, stemming from a singular literary source, resulted in many Judeans holding similar values, tightening the bonds within Jewish communities. Additionally, the Torah promoted the smaller community—immediate families—instructing, “[the Passover meal] shall be eaten in one house” and “[you] shall teach [the Shema] diligently to your children” (Exodus 12:46, Deuteronomy 6:7). In Frankenstein, Frankenstein’s creature—whose only interaction with humans had been that of disgust and rejection—was forced to live alone in the woods for several months. During this time, he describes his experience reading Sorrows of Werter: “I applied much personally to my own feelings and condition . . . I sympathised with and partly understood them” (Shelley 131). Through the novel, the creature is able to empathize with humans, despite his initial interaction, and lay a foundation of compassion for his upcoming positive interaction with the blind man De Lacey. While Frankenstein’s creature independently read novels he obtained in the woods, the Judeans used a single texts that many had access to. Despite the differences, both parties used text similarly: to establish a foundation for shared understanding. The Judeans understood each other, and Frankenstein’s creature understood humans.
In addition to connections, literature allowed the Judeans and Frankenstein’s creature to form a foundation from which beliefs could be built. The texts uncovered new ideas, enabling deeper comprehension. One of the most significant beliefs derived from the Torah was the idea that the Judaeans were a unique people. This belief was largely based on the aforementioned connections, as the sense of uniqueness emerged from the Judeans’ belief that they were chosen by God. The Torah informed the Judeans of the many things that God has done for them, such as promising Abram, “[God] will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great” and saving the Judeans from Egypt by “[striking] down all the [Egyptian] firstborn”  (Genesis 12:1-3, Exodus 12:29). From these beginnings flourished a vast religion—spurred by the belief of uniqueness—that would stand the test of time, persisting into the modern era, despite sustained persecution during the rise of Christianity and the crusades. In the case of Frankenstein’s creature, texts allowed him to understand the previously mysterious world, and form ideas of his own. From Plutarch’s Lives, Frankenstein’s creature learned “high thoughts” and “studied human nature”, enabling him to craft his own beliefs or “[elevate] . . . above the wretched sphere of my own reflections” (Shelley, 131). The creature details his values derived from Lives: “I felt . . . abhorrence for vice”, “I . . . admire peaceable lawgivers”, and finishes stating, “these impressions [took] a firm hold on my mind” (131-132). However, the rapture of new ideas dies down and a darker belief sets in when the creature finishes Paradise Lost. He attempts to draw connections between himself and the characters of the novel, but only finds contradiction. “God . . . made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours . . . Satan had his companions . . . but I am solitary and abhorred” (133). These texts allowed both the Judeans and Frankenstein’s creature to form beliefs of their own by uncovering new information to spark the beliefs.
Literature enabled the Judeans and Frankenstein’s creature to heighten their knowledge through the interpretations of texts. Many of the aforementioned beliefs depend on these unique interpretations, both of which are derived from texts. For the Judeans, many Jewish scholars emerged, constantly analyzing the sacred texts and advancing Judaism. Such scholars include Judah ha-Nasi, who produced the Jewish Code of Law, the Stamim, a group who edited the Talmud—a work regarded as “the heart of Judaism—and the scholars of the Mishnah Berakhot who debated the method of practicing the Shema (Solomon, Mishnah Berakhot 1:1-4). For Frankenstein’s creature—similar to the connections and beliefs—interpretations came at a more personal level. The unique interpretations that the creature makes demonstrates both his current outlook and his significant learning that emerged from the texts. From Sorrows of Werter, the creature explains, “disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder” and in Lives he “read of men . . . massacring their species” (Shelley, 131). Rather than being engulfed by morbid misery, or spurred by anger from the murder, the creature instead ponders the texts with curiosity. This curious approach is highlighted, as the creature refers to his cottage as a “school” (131). For the Judeans and Frankenstein’s creature alike, the interpretations of texts illuminated the path to new knowledge.
Literature is a broad medium and allows for a variety of usages. The Judeans and Frankenstein’s creature utilized texts similarly: to form a foundation from which connections, beliefs, and interpretations could be built. While many authors praise literature in their own works, such as Dante placing poets only in Limbo, the analysis of the Judeans’ and the creature’s use of literature allows a more precise understanding of the impact of texts. Understanding literature as a foundation allows for a greater appreciation of literature in various aspects of life.

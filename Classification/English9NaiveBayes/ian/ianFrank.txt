	After hours and hours of incredible labor and fatigue I succeeded in understanding the  source of production for the various limbs of the skeleton in progress; nay, more, I became myself capable of fashioning segments of a magnificent automaton though the operation of this hollow shell of a machine . This newfound expertise instilled me with much rapture and satisfaction, emotions most gratifying for the time spent whirling in prolonged toil.
	It was with these feelings I began the creation of the robot. The variety of sensations that enveloped me upon my first success were unimaginable. The distance between human and machine appeared ever so miniscule, a gap that I now possessed the capacity to surge beyond and forge such a contraption with my own two hands. A new creation would spiral into existence, one that could be manipulated, driven, and controlled by me and my colleagues, which would triumph over the others in the tournament the loomed overhead.
	These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my fabrication with unremitting ardor . My hands grew rugged and scraped with labor, and my person sagged from the perpetual days of unrelenting manufacture. Sometimes, on the very brink of completion, inaccuracies and miscalculations occured, spiralling the entirety of the element into insignificance; yet still I clung to the hope which I would succeed the production in the limited duration assigned to complete this task. My eyes swam with moisture and my head spun from tireless activity, and my legs began to buckle; but a resistless, and almost frantic impulse, urged me to return multiple times daily; I seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit .

The Evolution of Purpose
Never Let Me Go is a dystopian novel that follows Kathy H., one of many unwitting clones created to donate their organs, as she recounts events from her childhood until the present. Kathy tells stories that provide insight into her life at time exploring many themes that a maturing child would including friendship, social interactions, and identity. However, many of these stories revolve around a greater theme: her and her friends’ search for purpose. Ishiguro demonstrates their understanding of purpose through social interactions and emotions, illustrating how purposes change, and what causes these changes.
Ishiguro illustrates how prolonged exposure to specific values can cause one’s purpose to change, when Tommy challenges Kathy’s previous conception of her purpose. Tommy explains to Kathy what Miss Lucy had told him: “Well . . . The thing is, it might sound strange. It did to me at first. What she said was that if I didn’t want to be creative, if I really didn’t feel like it, that was perfectly all right. Nothing wrong with it, she said” (Ishiguro 23). Ishiguro builds the idea of not being creative is unorthodox and would be demeaned and disregarded through Tommy’s hesitant, repetitive sentences. These sentences, containing filler words such as, “[w]ell . . . The thing is” and repeating “if I really didn’t feel like it”, demonstrate Tommy’s worry when discussing this topic as it contradicts all of the Hailsham students’ previous notions of their purpose. This worry is immediately validated, as Kathy quickly snaps back, “‘[t]hat’s just rubbish, Tommy. If you’re going to play stupid games, I can’t be bothered’” (24). Kathy’s comment “[i]f you’re going to play stupid games” references a previous story in which she explains, “everyone knew Tommy was a better [soccer] player than any of that year” (8). Despite Tommy’s aptitude for sports, he doesn’t possess the skill that is valued at Hailsham: creativity, Tommy’s being described as “low as ever” (22). Kathy’s value for art, which was instilled through the culture at Hailsham, is shown when Tommy disputes that value.
Ishiguro illustrates an example of what causes one’s purpose to shift, in this case, it is a change of setting and the loss of mentors. This change of setting is Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth’s transition from Hailsham to the Cottages, additionally pulling them away from the guardians. At the Cottages, their perception of their purpose completely shifts. The trio experience a newfound independence, and the abandonment of their creativity-centric life leaves them searching for a new purpose and a plan for the future. Creativity’s departure is shown as Kathy describes how the former Hailsham students begin to forget what they previously valued. While Kathy still holds onto her essay—although more as a souvenir—she explains how “[o]ver time, [the essays] would fade from our minds” (115). Additionally when Kathy asks Ruth about her collection, one of the most prized possessions for Hailsham students, Ruth responds “in the end I threw them away” (131). Much of their time at the Cottages is centered around finding their “possibles”, a possible person that they are a clone of. Kathy explains that, “[o]ne big idea behind finding your model was that when you did, you’d glimpse your future” (139-140). This pursuit for new purpose and a glimpse of the future, which sprung from leaving Hailsham, drives many of the group’s actions at the Cottages.
Ruth’s search for her possible in Norfolk demonstrate the groups new value for the future, in addition to what can happen when someone is left without a purpose. The trip to climaxes when the group arrives at the office with Ruth’s potential and spots her, though Ruth is unsure that the woman is truly her mode. After this sighting Kathy depicts Ruth’s reaction: “Ruth . . . remained silent in the middle of it. It was hard to read her face at that moment: she certainly wasn’t disappointed, but then she wasn’t elated either. She had on a half-smile” (159). While this moment should bring Ruth lots of excitement, as she accomplished what she had been longing for, it instead leaves her only with a “half-smile”, as she didn’t have anything else to do. Furthermore, an office job was Ruth’s “dream future”, and such romanticising and over excitement, building up to a rather doubtful end, made Ruth quite disappointed (142). This disappointment was amplified when the group followed Ruth’s possible and concluded that it wasn’t Ruth’s model, causing Ruth’s disappointment to turn to anger and denial. Ruth stated that “I knew all along it was stupid”, then snapped shouting, “[t]hey don’t ever, ever, use people like that woman . . . We all know it. We’re modelled from trash” (166). Through these events Ishiguro shows the importance of having a purpose, and the negative effects the lack of one can have.
As the story nears the end and their choices begin to diminish, the trio starts to give up and realize their only purpose. The first time that purpose is explicitly mentioned in the novel is by Ruth who says Kathy and Tommy, “I was pretty much ready when I became a donor. It felt right. After all, it’s what we’re supposed to be doing, isn’t it” (227). Donations—a previously ignored subject—now envelop their lives and leave them no other options than to accept this new occupation. Furthermore, Ruth, who had the greatest aspirations out of the trio, now replaces her dream of an office job with the belief that donations are true purpose of the group. Kathy had noticed other carers with similar behavior to Ruth, explaining that many “are just going through the motions, waiting for the day they’re told they can stop and become donors” (208). Though many others are giving up and accepting their fate at donors, the three still believe in the idea of deferrals. However, even that is taken from them. Kathy and Tommy meet with Madame, who informs them that deferrals never existed and that “[their] life must now run the course that’s been set for it” (266). After this, the feeling of a fixed fate begins to set in. Kathy and Tommy continue their lives, along “the course that’s been set for [them]”, and no longer make attempts to escape donorship or pursue an alternate future. Losing hope after learning that deferrals didn’t exist caused Kathy and Tommy to finally accept donorship as their purpose.
Ishiguro’s final line of the book, “I just waited a bit, then turned back to the car, to drive off to wherever it was I was supposed to be”, provides a simple conclusion, and encapsulates the Kathy’s vision of her purpose (288). Although it still leaves many questions unanswered—such what happened to Hailsham or how clones are raised in other parts of the world—those questions don’t seem to need answers. The once inquisitive Kathy—investigating Madame’s gallery and searching for possibles—stops asking question after her interaction with Madame and Miss Emily. Now she has accepted her position as a carer, and a to-be donor. She states that she will “drive off to wherever is was” indicating that she doesn’t care or question where she is going, though she still believes that it is where she is “supposed to be”. The lack of choices and options changed Kathy purpose, now making her the one “going through the motions” (208).
	Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go explores the idea of purpose, and how one’s understanding of their purpose can change. Throughout the novel, the characters’ purposes change numerous times, and many of the changes are caused by entering new settings. However the most significant change and the one that had the most negative impact, was their entrance into the life of donation. This shift had the added effect of removing the characters’ ability to have a choice, which forced them to succumb to the life of donation. Ishiguro argues the importance of choice and admonishes the significant negative effects that the lack of choice can have.
